    <p>Soccer is a game where players try to hit a ball in a contained region in order to score goals on the opposing team. To score, you have to kick the ball into a rectangular enclosure which is guarded by an opposing “goalie”. This goalie tries to block the shot to prevent the other team from scoring. Some players include strikers (players who stay upfield and try to score), midfielders (players who stay midway through the field and pass up the field), and defenders (players who assist the goalie in defending the goal).</p>
